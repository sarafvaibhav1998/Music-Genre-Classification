# Music Genre Classification
- Application of Deep Learning and Classical Machine Learning Models to identify Song Genre based on the Mel-Spectrogram Analysis

## About
In this project, we plan to build models to classify audio clips into one of the 8 different music genres using various machine learning approaches.
The Neural Network Models were built using Keras, using TensorFlow as the backend and classical models were built using Scikit-Learn.

## Data
- Our library of audio samples was taken from the Free Music Archive (FMA) Dataset.
- 8000 songs samples from 8 genres; 30s each.
- Dataset is packaged with other preprocessing features such as track information, genres, and features extracted using librosa audio libraries.
- It consists of three csv files - features.csv,  tracks.csv, genres.csv
